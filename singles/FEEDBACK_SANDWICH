clue: The Connecticut, not the Maine, version of the sandwich called this roll gets my vote but why use a hot dog bun?

response: a lobster roll

clue: I love the contrast of the banh mi's julienned veggies with this long, thin French bread, but it's essential you toast it

response: a baguette

clue: I like the sweet marshmallow creme with savory peanut butter in this sammy, a New England fave, but don't love the texture

response: a fluffernutter

clue: You can count on enjoying this ham, turkey & Swiss sandwich, dipped in an egg & milk mix & then fried, but must you dip it in jam?

response: a Monte Cristo

clue: I'm glad we've gone from paper to wafers to cookies as the "bread" for this "sandwich"; I still like the old name, hokey pokey

response: an ice cream sandwich
